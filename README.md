A collection of scripts (callable via `ictest ...`, see `ictest --help`)
developed for automated test generation, verification and coverage analysis
during the _VLSI Processor Design_ lab at TU-Dresden. These scripts are heavily
intertwined with the corresponding Verilog Z80 implementation and are currently
not very useful outside of that project (which will be uploaded to GitHub at a
later date). The scripts also depend on the `z80asm` and `z80sim` programs
written by Udo Munk and available at
https://www.autometer.de/unix4fun/z80pack/.
